## The comparison of default rate and usage between 2007 and 2019
**Q1: We want to see the default rate in time series chart to see the changes of default rate over the years.** 
- By looking at figure 1, we can see the default rate in 2007 Q4 was 0.09133115, which is the highest rate overall. Compared to 2019 Q4, the default rate was 0.002042572, which is much lower than 2007 Q4. We can first take this result due to the financial crisis in 2008, with the reason of Subprime Mortgage. According to the news, there were more than 2.66 million houses of homeowners that are unable to pay their mortgages. The mortgage market experienced a notable decrease in default rates from 2007 to 2019, attributed to improvements following the financial crisis.

**Q2: Let’s discover the changes of number of borrowers per state between 2007 and 2019.**
- From the interactive chart 2, California has the highest borrowers in both 2007 and 2019. Besides from the borrowers per state, we can see that the number of borrowers in 2019 was nearly 2 times greater than numbers of borrowers in 2007. This suggests sustained demand for mortgages, reflecting economic growth and housing market dynamics.

- As we want to see the data clearer, we use the interactive bar chart and scatterplot 3 to see the defferent number of borrowers between 2007 and 2019. From this figure and the previous figure 2 of us map, we discover that California’s number of borrowers in 2019 was 8781, nearly two times greater than 2007 (4434 borrowers). While other states did not have much differences than California between 2007 and 2019. As from the scatter plot, we can see that the relationship between number of borrowers in 2007 and 2019 has a positive relationship.

**Q3: How many borrowers whose credit score greater than 700 turned out to be default in different channel during the period?**
- We use credit score over 700 to represent a good credit score. By using the group bar chart, we find out that borrowers in 2007 4 had higher default rate than borrowers in 2019 5. Calculating manually for the default rate, borrowers with channel used by Broker has the highest default rate with 0.094 in 2007 and 0.002 in 2019. Moreover, people with credit score over 700 increase a lot during the period. Last but not least, we find out that the most channel used by the party that delivered the loan to issuer had changed from Correspondent to Retail. Borrowers with credit scores over 700 exhibited lower default rates in 2019, indicating a shift towards more creditworthy borrowers.
